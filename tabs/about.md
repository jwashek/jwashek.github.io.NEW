My name is Justin and I've been living my dream job as a Penetration Tester since June 2020 and loving every minute of the journey so far! I am currently <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f7f54f7e-b6fa-42c7-997d-2072a42aaa04/public_url">OSCP</a> and <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/16926d2c-c2c2-4bf6-9fee-4f72b33b3aef/public_url">Pentest+</a> certified and pursuing just about every penetration testing course/certification that I can get my hands on.<br><br>
While I'm not hacking for my role, I participate in Bug Bounty Hunting and CTFs to keep my skills sharp and aligned with current industry trends and technologies.<br><br> My hope for this blog is to post my penetration testing experiences, bugs found through Bug Bounty Hunting, and CTF writeups -- all while trying to share as much knowlege as possible to help the community (and myself) to git gud.</h3>
